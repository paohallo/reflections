When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

An example of this is when you are working with remote teams or collaborating on an open source project, 
where you want to share content.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The reasons for this, include not ready to release the content, as in, you are working on a feature, and you want to complete the feature before you want others to consume or modify that feature.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you

    Fork is the same as a repository clone, but is a remote operation handled on GitHub or GitLab. Clones are a mirror or content either of a remote repository or a local repository. Branches and differences of content with a repository, either remote or local.
